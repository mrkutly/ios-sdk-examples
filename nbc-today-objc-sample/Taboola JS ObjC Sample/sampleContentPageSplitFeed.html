      <h2>How to Create Holiday Marketing Content</h2>

         width="400">
      <p>The holiday season is fast approaching. This time of year is when many customers spend the
         most—Deloitte reports that the average consumer spends about $1,000 on gifts.
      </p>
      <p> With this type of spending power, it’s important for businesses to be prepared and offer
         enticing offers for their customers.
      </p>
      <p> Many businesses are busy getting their websites ready for increased sales, but what about a
         seasonal content strategy? Creating seasonal marketing content around the holidays can have a
         significant impact on a customer’s average spend, order amount, and the likelihood they will
         refer a company to another potential buyer.
      </p>
      <p>These are some holiday content marketing ideas to help your products stand out.</p>
      <h3>How to Create Holiday Marketing Content</h3>
      <p>Gift guides are used by many e-commerce websites to showcase their best products and offer
         customers gift ideas for their family, children, friends, and others.
      </p>
      <p>Almost any e-commerce site can offer a gift guide with sections for specific people.</p>
      <p>The key to a good gift guide is either really niche categories, like “young bookworms” or
         really unique ideas that not everyone is sharing.
      </p>
      <p> For example, many pieces of content have likely suggested a spa kit for your sister-in-law,
         but fewer would probably recommend a wine box subscription or a necklace with her name in
         braille. Consider the recipient, and what they would actually use.
      </p>
      <p>Here’s an <a href="https://www.uncommongoods.com/blog/2017/geek-gifts-space/">example from
         Uncommon Goods</a>, an e-retailer specializing in fun and unique products:
      </p>
      <img src="https://blog.taboola.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/holiday-marketing-content-1.png"
         alt="holiday marketing content (1)" width="300">
      <p>This niche gift guide is perfect because buyers can choose something based on the recipient’s
         likes or personality, and it’s easy for the retailer to place things into specific
         topics.
      </p>
      <p>Even if you aren’t an e-commerce retailer, you can still create gift guide content. </p>
      <p>If you do sales training, for example, you could offer a blog post about the “10 best gifts
         for salespeople.”
      </p>
      <p>Either way, gift guides are a great way to not only drive sales but traffic to your website.
         Make sure to include sharing buttons so your content can be shared via email and social
         media.

      <!--this is where taboola feed starts-->
      <div id='split_1'></div>

      <!--start of split text-->
      <div id='split_div'>
         <p><font face="verdana" color="red"><strong>Note:</strong> This is the start of split section, this is not part of the feed</font></p>
         <h3>Interactive Elements</h3>
         <p>Another fun type of content that does well over the holidays is interactive content, like online quizzes, calculators, or other tools </p>
         <p>One sensationally popular example is Elf Yourself, which is used by Office Max/Office Depot to promote themselves as a holiday destination. </p>
         <p>Users upload photos of themselves and their friends and family (or pull it from Facebook) and choose the elves’ song and dance. The website then creates a fun short video that has dancing elves with the photos imposed onto their heads.
         </p>
         <img src="https://blog.taboola.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/holiday-marketing-content-2.jpg"
            width="400">
         <p>The website and tool were created in 2006 and <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20151104005115/en/Office-Depot-Elf-Yourself%C2%AE-App-Creates-Billion"> over 1.5 billion elves have been created </a> since its inception.</p>
         <p>Office Max & Office Depot get widespread publicity from the tool: it links to its main website and they are mentioned in every video link that is shared by users. It works well because users are going to want to share it with the friends and family they’ve placed into the video. This then creates a ripple effect—those people create their own video and share it with others.</p>
         <p>What types of tools or game content could your company release this year? It doesn’t have to be as complicated as Elf Yourself—even a budgeting calculator or free holiday printables (like holiday or thank you cards) would be a great addition.    </p>
         <p>If you don’t have time to create unique content, consider creating a round-up blog post to share others’ content.    </p>
         <p>Just be sure to link to their content and give full attribution, <a href="https://www.babble.com/home/free-holiday-printables/"> as Babble does in this free holiday printables blog post. </a></p>
